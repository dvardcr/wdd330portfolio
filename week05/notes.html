        <h2>Testing and Debugging</h2>

        <p>Because we are responsible for programming errors, we must guarantee that they are minimized and corrected as
            soon as feasible. It may even be argued that user errors are also programmer errors, because the program
            should be designed in such a way that the user does not make the mistake. Silent failure makes problems more
            difficult to detect and track down.</p>

        <h3>Exceptions</h3>
        <p>An exception is an error that generates a return value that the software can use to handle the error.</p>

        <h3>Stack Traces</h3>

        <p>This is a series of functions or method calls that led to the error. To find the original function or method
            that started the sequence, a stack trace will work backwards from the point where the problem occurred.</p>


        <h3>Warnings</h3>

        <p>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This
            means the program will continue to run despite the warning.</p>

        <h3>Strict Mode</h3>

        <p>Strict mode simply requires the following string to be added to the first line of a JavaScript file, it can
            be added inside a function: 'use strict';</p>
        <p><b>The recommended way to invoke strict mode is to place all your code into a self-invoking function.</b></p>

        <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
        <p>Linting tools like JS Lint, JS Hint, and ES Lint can be used to test the quality of JavaScript code. They can
            also be used to enforce programming style guidelines. Although passing a lint test does not guarantee that
            your code is right, it does indicate that it is more consistent and less prone to errors.</p>

        <h3>Feature Detection</h3>
        <p>It is done using an if statement to check whether an object or method exists before trying to actually call
            the method.</p>

        <h3>Debugging - The Alert</h3>
        <p><code>alert()</code> stops a program from running until OK is clicked, it allows us to effectively put
            breakpoints in the code that let us check the value of variables at that point to see if they’re what we
            expect them to be.</p>

        <h3>Debugging - Console</h3>
        <p>The console.log() method has already been seen and utilized. This can be used to log the value of variables
            at various points in the program, albeit it does not stop the program from running in the same way that
            alert does.</p>

        <h3>Debugging - Online Tools</h3>
        <p>Most current browsers now provide a debugging feature that allows you to set breakpoints in your code,
            pausing it at specific points. You can then see and change the values of all the variables at those points.
        </p>

        <h3>Error Objects</h3>
        <p>An <code>error</error> object can be created by the host environment when an exception occurs, or it can be
                created in the code using a constructor function</p>
        <p>const error = new Error('Oops, something went wrong');</p>
        <p>There are seven more error objects used for specific errors:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>EvalError</code> is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for
                backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global <code>eval()</code>
                function.</li>

            <li><code>RangeError</code> is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>

            <li><code>ReferenceError</code> is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For
                example, calling a function that hasn't been defined.</li>

            <li><code>SyntaxError</code> is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.</li>

            <li><code>TypeError</code> is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string
                is used when a number is expected.</li>

            <li><code>URIError</code> is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding the URI.</li>

            <li><code>InternalError</code> is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript
                engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Throwing Exceptions</h3>
        <p>It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions using the <code>throw</code> statement.</p>

        <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
        <p>If we suspect a piece of code will result in an exception, we can wrap it in a try block. This will run the
            code inside the block as normal, but if an exception occurs it will pass the error object that is thrown
            onto a catch block.</p>

        <h3>Test-driven Development</h3>

        <ul>
            <ol>Write tests (that initially fail)</ol>

            <ol>Write code to pass the tests</ol>

            <ol>Refactor the code</ol>

            <ol>Test refactored code</ol>

            <ol>Write more tests for new features</ol>
        </ul>

        <p>This is often referred to as the “red-green-refactor” cycle of TDD, as failing tests usually show up as red,
            and tests that pass show as green.</p>

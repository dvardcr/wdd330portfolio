            The applications we create must cover a bidirectional communication between the creator and the end-user. The input from the end-user will help us understand what needs improvement. Storing that input is our priority because the app might be closed, and we do not want to end-user to lose information they wanted to keep for later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through creating variables and setting functions we can save, recall and display the input from the end-user. Using the getElementById can call different elements. We'll refer to an input or text field as a "value," and a section as "innerHTML."

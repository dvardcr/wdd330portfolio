        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <p>It’s possible and becoming common to process the information in a form on the 'front end' before it is sent
            to the server using JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>Form Events</h3>
        <p>Forms trigger a number of events which are exclusive to forms.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>focus</code> - element is focused on</li>
            <li><code>blur</code> - moves the focus away from the form element</li>
            <li><code>change</code> - occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form element after changing it
            </li>
            <li><code>submit</code> - occurs when the form is submitted</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Retrieving and Changing Values From a Form</h3>
        <p>Text input element objects have a <code>value</code> property that can be used to retrieve the text inside
            the field. We can use this to report back what the user has searched for.<p>

                <h3>Form Controls</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li><code><input></code> - fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file
                        uploads</li>
                    <li><code><select></code> - menus for drop-down lists of options</li>
                    <li><code><textarea></code> - elements for longer text entry</li>
<li><code><button></code> - elements for submitting and resetting forms</li>
<li><code>autofocus</code> - attribute give focus to this element when a page loads</li>
<li><code>placeholder</code> - attribute will insert the value provided in the input field until the user enters some text</li>
<li><code>maxlength</code> - attribute will limit the number of characters that can be entered in the field to the value given</li>
type='hidden' - not displayed by the browser, but have a 'value' attribute that can contain information that is submitted with the form
type='file' - these are used to upload files
</ul>

<h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
<p>Is often used to model representations of objects in the real world.</p>

<h3>Encapsulation</h3>

<p>Keeping all the programming logic inside an object and making methods available to implement the functionality</p>

<h3>Polymorphism</h3>

<p>The same process can be used for different objects. Various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>

<p>This means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by adding new properties and methods.</p>

<h3>Classes</h3>

<p>The class is like a blueprint for an object. Objects are then created as an instance of that class, and inherit all the properties and methods of the class. In JavaScript, an object can be known as a prototype.</p>

<p>We can use the constructor property to instantiate a copy of an object, without having to reference the actual constructor function or class declaration directly.</p>

<h3>Prototypal Inheritance</h3>

<p>Every class has a prototype property that is shared by every instance of the class. So any properties or methods of a class’s prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by that class.</p>

<p>The prototype can be used to add any new properties and methods after the class has been declared.</p>

<p>To summarize, the following points should be considered when using classes and prototypes to create instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a class declaration that deals with any initialization, shared properties and methods.</li>

<li>Any extra methods and properties that need to be augmented to the class declaration after it’s been defined can be added to the prototype. These will be added to all instances, even those that have already been created.</li>

<li>Add any properties or methods that are individual to a particular instance can be augmented using assignment to that object (a mixin could be used to add multiple properties at once, as we’ll see later).</li>

<li>Be careful when overwriting the prototype completely ― the constructor class needs to be reset.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Public and Private Methods</h3>

<p>We can use the concept of variable scope to keep some properties and methods private inside of a class declaration. This will prevent them from being accessed or changed. Instead, we will provide a <b>getter method</b> to return the values of any private properties.</p>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>	

<p>Good practice is for all built-in methods to be non-enumerable, and any user-defined methods to be made enumerable.</p>

<p>Inside the child class declaration, the keyword <code>super</code> refers to the parent class, and can be used to access any properties and call any methods of the parent class.</p>


<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
<p>The concept of polymorphism means that different objects can have the same method, but implement it in different ways.</p>

<p>The toString() method is a good demonstration of polymorphism, since different objects have the same method but implement it differently.</p>

<p>The <b>monkey-patching</b> is the practice to add more methods to the prototype of JavaScript’s built-in objects — such as Number, String, and Array — to add more functionality.</p>

<h3>Property Attributes and Descriptors</h3>

<p>All object properties have the following attributes stored in a property descriptor:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>value</code> ― This is the value of the property and is undefined by default</li>

<li><code>writable</code> ― This boolean value shows whether a property can be changed or not, and is false by default</li>

<li><code>enumerable</code> ― this boolean value shows whether a property will show up when the object is displayed in a for in loop, and is false by default</li>

<li><code>configurable</code> ― this boolean value shows whether you can delete a property or change any of its attributes, and is false by default.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Creating Objects from Other Objects</h3>

<p>The <code>Object()</code> constructor function has a method called <code>create</code> that can be used to create a new object that is an exact copy of the object that is provided as an argument. The object that is provided as the argument acts as the prototype for the new object.</p>


<h3>Mixins</h3>

<p>A mixin is a way of adding properties and methods of some objects to another object without using inheritance. It allows more complex objects to be created by ‘mixing’ basic objects together.</p>

<p>One use for the mixin() function is to add a large number of properties to an object all at once.</p>

<h2>IMPORTANT</h2>
<p>One way to think about the difference between prototypal inheritance and inheritance from mixin objects is to consider whether an object is something or whether it has something.</p>

<p><i>is</i> something = prototypal inheritance</p>
<p><i>has</i> something = mixin objects</p>


<h3>Chaining Functions</h3>

<p>If a method returns <code>this</code>, its methods can be chained together to form a sequence of method calls that are called one after the other.</p>

<h3>Composition Over Inheritance</h3>

<i>You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.</i>

<p>The problem he describes is that if an object requires a <code>banana()</code> method that belongs to the <code>Gorilla</code> class, you have to inherit the whole class to gain access to that method. But as well as the method you wanted, the object also inherits a lot of other properties and methods that are not needed, causing it to become unnecessarily bloated.</p>

<p><b>Composition over inheritance sees objects as building blocks that go together to make other objects rather than classes that are monolithic structures layered on top of each other.</b></p>

<h2>Modern JavaScript Development</h2>

<p>There are a few important points about modules that are worth keeping in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>All code in modules is always in strict mode without the need for 'use strict' and there is no way to opt out of this.</li>
<li>A module has its own global scope, so any variables created in the top-level of a module can only be accessed within that module.</li>
<li>The value of <code>this</code> in the top level of a module is <code>undefined</code>, rather than the global object.</li>
<li>You can't use HTML-style comments in modules (although this isn't very common in any JavaScript program these days).</li>
</ul>

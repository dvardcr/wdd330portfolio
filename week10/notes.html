        <h2>Client-side form validation</h2>
<p>It is an initial check and an important practice of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away.</p>
<p>Your apps should always perform security checks on any form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side, because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious users can still easily send bad data through to your server.</p>

<p>Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the server is called server-side validation.</p>

<ul>
<li>Get the right data, in the right format.</li>
<li>Protect our users' data.</li>
<li>Protect ourselves.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Built-in form validation</h3>

<p>HTML5 form controls is the ability to validate most user data without relying on JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
<li>required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the form can be submitted.</li>
<li>minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual data (strings)</li>
<li>min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types</li>
<li>type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some other specific preset type.</li>
<li>pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data needs to follow.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are several errors that will prevent the form from being submitted, including a badInput, patternMismatch, rangeOverflow or rangeUnderflow, stepMismatch, tooLong or tooShort, typeMismatch, valueMissing, or a customError.</p>

<h2>The Constraint Validation API</h2>
<p>It is a set of methods and properties available on the following form element DOM interfaces:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTMLButtonElement (represents a <button> element)</li>
<li>HTMLFieldSetElement (represents a <fieldset> element)</li>
<li>HTMLInputElement (represents an <input> element)</li>
<li>HTMLOutputElement (represents an <output> element)</li>
<li>HTMLSelectElement (represents a <select> element)</li>
<li>HTMLTextAreaElement (represents a <textarea> element)</li>
</ul>

<p>These automated messages have two drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no standard way to change their look and feel with CSS.</li>
<li>They depend on the browser locale, which means that you can have a page in one language but an error message displayed in another language.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fetch API</h2>
<p>The Promise returned from fetch() won't reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, as soon as the server responds with headers, the Promise will resolve normally, and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.</p>

<p>fetch() won't send cross-origin cookies unless you set the credentials init option.</p>

<p>The simplest use of fetch() takes one argument — the path to the resource you want to fetch — and does not directly return the JSON response body but instead returns a promise that resolves with a Response object.</p>

<p>The Response object, in turn, does not directly contain the actual JSON response body but is instead a representation of the entire HTTP response. So, to extract the JSON body content from the Response object, we use the json() method, which returns a second promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON.</p>

<p>The Headers interface allows you to create your own headers object via the Headers() constructor. A headers object is a simple multi-map of names to values.</p>

<p>Since headers can be sent in requests and received in responses, and have various limitations about what information can and should be mutable, headers' objects have a guard property.</p>

        <p>Added a separate HTML for the Animation exercises.</p>
